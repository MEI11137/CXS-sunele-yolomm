"""Zero-registration pruning engine for YOLOMM / RTDETRMM.

Dependency discovery is fully automatic (TorchDispatchMode operator tracing +
per-channel index-map propagation + slot/unit partitioning). Any module that
parse_model can build and the model can forward is either pruned correctly,
skipped conservatively with a reported reason, or refused with an explanation.

Structured (physical channel removal), unstructured and 2:4 semi-structured
sparsity share the same lifecycle (prune -> finetrain -> val/export). Pruning
criteria are pluggable via criteria.register_importance.
